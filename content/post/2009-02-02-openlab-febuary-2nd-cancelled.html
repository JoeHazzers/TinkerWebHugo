We have been informed that the UKC campus is <strong>closing at 1PM today</strong> to ensure that people don't get stranded in the bad weather.  As such, tonight's OpenLab has had to be cancelled.

I suggest that you go home, have a mug of hot chocolate (preferably Whittards), and make some snowmen.  Maybe you can do better than my<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/naxxtor/3247483780/ "> Snow Totoro</a>.

Pics or it didn't happen!
