Hi Everyone,

This week's meeting (15th) will be the first of a two part session on metal
casting!

We will be meeting in KS17 at 1900 as usual to create the moulds we plan to
cast in a couple of weeks time.

We need some aluminum, so starting collecting all your old aluminum cans, HDD
platters and other scraps.

The meeting on the 22nd will be another open mic. If you would like to give a
talk please let us know.

Cheers!
