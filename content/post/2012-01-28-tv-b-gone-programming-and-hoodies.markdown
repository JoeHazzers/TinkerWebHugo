Hi Everyone!

Hopefully everyone enjoyed our first trip to the lab this year, and some of
you even had working TV-B-Gones. Result.

This Monday at 6.00pm in the sim lab in the Jennison building we're going
to be teaching you how to program the chips, and heading off to somewhere
with a TV to try it out. This will be a free session, just make sure you
bring along the TV-B-Gone you made last week!

Hoodies: Orders have been placed, payment has been made, and information
about when hoodies are coming is one the way. It shouldn't be long now,
sorry to keep you all waiting.

Cheers,

Matt
