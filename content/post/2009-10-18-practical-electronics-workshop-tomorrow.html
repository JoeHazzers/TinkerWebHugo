<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In this workshop we taught you the basics of electronics, covering key concepts such as current/voltage, resistance, capacitance etc. and we played around with breadboards and components to wire up some simple circuits!</span>

This workshop was mainly for non Electronic Engineering people and we tried to keep the theory to a minimum and focus on the practical applications.

Hope you enjoyed it!
