Hey everyone, This is a reminder that there is a meeting tomorrow in KS17
(Keynes).

It will be an open mic night, where people come along and give a short talk
about a project they built. The Monday after that shall be our first social
(Spud Cannon Archery) and will mark the end of our free taster sessions. So see
you all tomorrow from 7PM.

Dan
