            <h1>Welcome to TinkerSoc <br><small>The University of Kent's Maker Society</small></h1>
            <p>TinkerSoc is the society where we build, hack and (sometimes) blow things up.
            TinkerSoc is not just about electronics, but we do like our fair share of LEDs.
            It is a society that embraces all forms of technology, engineering and craft.</p>
